Function call loop can lead stack overflow, How can we detect it in runtime?   For example 
A-->B-->C-->A.

C++11 introduces lamba expression, what is the advantage of the feature? Does it make program 
run faster than before or use less memory? Does this expression debug friendly? Watch varible,
set breakpoints, evaluate expression is more convenient?
