It would introduce OpenGL programming by a simple example.

## OpenGL Programming

Most of 3D models are presented by triangles. Those triangles make the surface of 3D objects. Rendering is the process to transform 3D models into 2D image. It maybe done by an offline path tracer or a real time renderer. The topic today is about real time rendering by OpenGL. It is grouped into four parts : Geometry data preparation, Shading surface, Show shading result, and Manipulation.
