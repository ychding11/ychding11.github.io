## GPU Work Submission
- **Command Queue**
  - It is **a little** like **Device Context** in D3D11.
  - It is thread safe, much fit for multi-threading environment.
  - Command Buffer can encoded by different encoders serially, So a Command Buffer may contain render commands, compute commands, blit commands ? 
- **Command Buffer**
  - It encodes and packs "GPU Commands" explicitly by a "Command Encoder".
  - Each thread can have its own "Command Buffer" and operates on it.
  - It has a **addCompletedHandler** interface to add call back function when command buffer completed execution.
  - Can **Command Buffer** be reused after submitted ? It seems not.
- **Command Encoder**
  - It is used to encode GPU commands into buffer. It has its own scope. That is:
    - bound resource in current encoder, no need to rebind before draw
    - bound resource in other encoder, not affect current encoder.
  - Render Command Encoder is created from Command Buffer by a Render Pass descriptor.
  - Compute and Blit command Encoder, there is no such constraints, because they are independent of Rendering.
  - Render Command Encoder is 1:1 map to "A Render Pass". 
  - Render Command Encoder can only be created serially except of Parallel Render command Encoder. That is before end encoding one you cannot create a new one.
    - create encoder
    - encoder GPU commands
    - endEncoding
  - Render Command Encoder contains an implicit "ClearColor" command. Clear operation is very different with other Graphics library. That is Encoder has no explicit command to use. It must set it by a Render Pass descriptor.
- **MTLRenderPassDescriptor**
  - It is used to create "Render Command Encoder" from commandBuffer by renderCommandEncoderWithDescriptor
  - It is a description of output of a Render Pass. There is **NO** counterpart in D3D11.
  - What role does it play in rendering process ?
    - It contains color attachment array, depth attachment and stencil attachment. 
    - Sample position operations of Multi-Sample technique. It gives a way to do custom MSAA. Does D3D provide API to do these things ? 
    - Layered Rendering, Tile Shading 
    - Visibility Result buffer. How this buffer is written and queried ?
## Render Pipeline State (PSO) in Metal
- **MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor** is used to create MTLRenderPipelineState object from device
  - calling *newRenderPipelineStateWithDescriptor* to create **MTLRenderPipelineState** .
  - Vertex function, Fragment function. How about tessellation and geometry stage ?
      - D3D11 compiles source code into byte code, then generates shader objects from byte code.
      - D3D11 binds different Shader objects to  different stages at run time.
  - Vertex layout description
  - Rasterizer sample count For MSAA
  - color attachment description array, depth format, stencil format. 
    - D3D11 use Resource View: RTV, DSV, SRV / CBV / UAV.
  - Tessellation related settings.
  - MTLPipelineBufferDescriptorArray, what is this ?

- **MTLDepthStencilDescriptor && MTLDepthStencilState** 
  - create **MTLDepthStencilState** object from device by MTLDepthStencilDescriptor to represent Depth Stencil state to GPU.
  - [MTLDepthStencilDescriptor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldepthstencildescriptor?language=objc)
    - depthWriteEnabled, Whether to enalbe write to depth attachment.
    - depthCompareFunction, How to compare current fragment's z with that in depth attachment.
    - backFace and frontFace Stencil state. see details [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlstencildescriptor?language=objc). It explains How stencil value are compared and updated. It is a bit complicated.
  - DepthStecnil buffer **must be** a private ressource. Is it true in D3D12 ?  
    - It requires extra temp non-private resource to create a private resouce with init value.
  -  Why not include MTLDepthStencilState in MTLRenderPipelineState just like D3D12 ?  In metal, it require to set           depth-stencil state and stencil reference value explicit by a render encoder.  
  `[renderEncoder setDepthStencilState:_writeDepthStencilState]; [renderEncoder setStencilReferenceValue:0x10];`

## Present Rendering Result
- How to present rendering results in Metal ? `[commandBuffer presentDrawable:view.currentDrawable];`
  - submission thread will wait this command buffer completed ?
  - how about vsync ?
