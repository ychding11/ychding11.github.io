## SIGGRAPH 

- [Casting curved shadows on curved surface](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/274/15/papers/p270-williams.pdf) This is the original idea 
of shadow mapping which widely used in shadow computation. No math formula in paper, it is very good for beginners.
- [Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/73939/p286-blinn.pdf) The paper presents normal mapping ideas
first time. 

## Graphic Course 
- [Real-Time High Quality Rendering](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/274/15/274.html) The course has some advanced topics, so it is not 
a good choice for beginners. 
- [CMU Graphics Course Collection](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/?page_id=16) Lots of materials for you to start CG explore.
- [Stanford Graphics Course Collection](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/) Slides Papers and Assignments   
- [Introduction to 3D Image Generation](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~hwshen/781/Site/Main.html)

## OpenGL

- [OpenGL3.x Specification](https://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec32.core.20091207.pdf) This is an OpenGL specifications 
containing lotsof detailed description of OpenGL design. Perhaps We should regard it as a dictionary for lookup when in need.  
- [Next Generation OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/events/Next-Generation-OpenGL-Dec14.pdf)The slide has a very
concrete description about 3D API of Khonoros group. It provides a family tree clearly depicting the relationship between
OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL. It is very helpful to new beginners. Next generation API design is the main focus of slide, a
comparison list about traditional API and next-generation API design can tell lots of stories. Platform diversity and
radically changed GPU architecture drive such changes. 
- [Ambient Diffuse Specular Lighting Model](http://www.learnopengl.com/#!Lighting/Basic-Lighting) The web link may help to understand 
basic ideas of ADS.  
- [Graphics Gems PDF Version](https://github.com/tl3shi/books/tree/master/GameDev/Graphics) It is a very good collection of Graphics 
related books.  
- [OpenGL Shader tutorials](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/tutorials/TyphoonLabs/Chapter_4.pdf) talks about some advancted lighting 
techniques widely used in OpenGL, including per-pixel illumination model, bump mapping, displacement mapping and so on.

## Bump mapping, Normal mapping and Displacement mapping

- [Bump Normal Displacement mapping comparison](http://blog.digitaltutors.com/bump-normal-and-displacement-maps/) This blog post gives 
a comparison about bump mapping, normal mapping, displacement mapping. It is helpful for beginners to construct  
overview concepts about those techniques.
