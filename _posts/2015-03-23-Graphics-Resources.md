## SIGGRAPH 

- [Casting curved shadows on curved surface](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/274/15/papers/p270-williams.pdf) This is the original idea 
of shadow mapping which widely used in shadow computation. No math formula in paper, it is very good for beginners.
- [Simulation of Wrinkled Surfaces](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/73939/p286-blinn.pdf) The paper presents normal mapping ideas
first time. 

## Graphic Course 
- [Real-Time High Quality Rendering](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/274/15/274.html) The course has some advanced topics, so it is not 
a good choice for beginners. 
- [CMU Graphics Course Collection](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/?page_id=16) Lots of materials for you to start CG explore.
- [Stanford Graphics Course Collection](http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/) Slides Papers and Assignments   

## OpenGL

- [OpenGL3.x Specification](https://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/glspec32.core.20091207.pdf) This is an OpenGL specifications 
containing lotsof detailed description of OpenGL design. Perhaps We should regard it as a dictionary for lookup when in need.  
- [Next Generation OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/events/Next-Generation-OpenGL-Dec14.pdf)The slide has a very
concrete description about 3D API of Khonoros group. It provides a family tree clearly depicting the relationship between
OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL. It is very helpful to new beginners. Next generation API design is the main focus of slide, a
comparison list about traditional API and next-generation API design can tell lots of stories. Platform diversity and
radically changed GPU architecture drive such changes.
